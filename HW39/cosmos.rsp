Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
-simple set of rules: 
 test ideas by experiment and observation
 build on those ideas that pass the test
 reject those that fail
 follow evidence wherever it leads
 question everything
-voyager one: contains information about how we live, to be discovered by others
-Jupiter's mass is greater than the combined mass of all other planets in our solar system.
-Our cosmic address is :
  Earth
  Solar System
  Milky Way Galaxy
  Local Group
  Virgo Supercluster
  Observable Universe
-The first to suggest that the Earth was not the center of everything was Copernicus. His book became forbidden by the Catholic Church
-Bruno, a monk at the time, found his book, read it, and believed it. Bruno also believed in an infinite cosmos, although he had no evidence to support it. He thought that, because God was infinite, his creation must be, too. He was excommunicated by the Catholic Church, by the Calvinists and by the Lutherans. Bruno was then asked to speak in England, and went. His audience rejected what he said, and he returned to Italy. There, he was imprisoned for eight years and refused to recant his claims.
-Ten years later, Galileo discovered that Bruno was right with the use of a telescope.
-we are made of "star stuff": elements come from old stars
-the calendar of the cosmic year starting with the big bang on January 1 and the present on December 31 is an interesting representation of time. Saying that the first flower blooed on December 28 provides a good perspective on how recently developed our way of life is. Humans only came to be in the last hour of this calendar.
-Carl Sagan guided Cosmos a generation agian, most successful science communicator of the twentieth century
 correctly predicted the existence of methane links on Saturn's moon, Titan. as well as other discoveries
-Sagan also reached out to Tyson when he was a 17 year old, invited him to Cornell University. He inspired Tyson to do science, and to become a person like Sagan.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
- The best thing humanity had to offer was our intelligence, especially our gift for pattern recognition. We used this gift to read the pattern in the sky.
- Peoples' lives were largely based on what they read from the skies. So when a comet appeared, people had no other logical explanation except that it was a message from god. Most civilizations concluded that it was a bad foreshadowing.
- Our gift in pattern recognition is a double-edged sword. We sometimes deceive ourselves into finding patterns that doesn't exist -- false pattern recognition.
- Where do all the comets come from? Comets can be gravitationally ejected out of the solar system and exiled into space. Yet somehow, the comets still keep coming. Jan Oort concluded that the Oort Cloud -- an enormous swarm of floating preserved remnants and mountains of ice and rocks from the birth of the solar system. Yet, no one's ever seen the Oort Cloud.
- In the Oort Cloud, comets are so far apart that a tiny tug from a planet will pull it away from its trajectory and throw it into a freefall in space. When it reaches our inner solar system, heat from the Sun bakes it, and the melting ice from the comet forms a glowing halo and a tail.
- Humans had no explanation for the apparition of comets except for their guilt and fears.
- Robert Hooke was possibly the most inventive person who ever lived. He discovered the cell through a compound microscope that he invented, improved the telescope, redesigned and rebuilt London after the great fire, derived Hooke's Law, and perfected the air pump.
- Edmond Halley was born curious. Halley drew the first full map of the sky, by which people could navigate by stars visible from anywhere. After publishing the Principia with Newton, he made the first map of the Earth's magnetic field, invented the weather map, laid the groundworks for population statistics, found the actual scale of the solar system, and realized that all stars are moving.
- Coffeehouses in London were places of equality where people shared news and launched ideas. Halley, Hooke, and Christopher Wren met at a house and wondered, "Why do the planets move as they do?" Halley sought out Isaac Newton when they failed to produce results.
- Isaac Newton found refuge in his passion to understand how things worked, especially nature itself. Newton kept to himself while he studied. Newton had already discovered the equation explaining why planets orbit in an elliptical pattern around the sun when Halley proposed his question. Halley asked to him to write his research into a book, but they didn't have money to publish these books of scientific revolution. Halley took it upon himself to see to the printing and publishing of Newton's genius.
- In the past, people looked at the perfection of the clockwards motions of planets in the sky as work of God. Whilst a God-loving man, Isaac Newton looked at the solar system as a whole and wrote laws that applied universally to apples and planets, dispelling the idea that God shaped our world and opening way to more questions. He introduced the idea of space travel. By find the natural laws governing the motions of comets, he severed the motions of the heavens from their ancient connections to our fears.
- Halley set out to discover what comics were and discovered that comets were bound to the Sun in long elliptical orbits. In an age when comets were merely omens of human events, Halley predicted with precision the future appearance of a comet that revolves around the sun, returning to Earth every 74 years.
- Newton's laws allowed for Halley's prophecy, for scientists nowadays to travel to moon, and for us to begin understanding the cosmos.
