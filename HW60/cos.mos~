Episode 7 - "The Clean Room"



- When earth gained sufficient gravity, it began pulling objects into crossing orbits, so the question was how could we know the true age of our world



- Archbishop James Ussher searched for an event in the Old Testament that corresponded to a known date: in the Second Book of Kings, the death of Nebuchadnezzar in 562 BC. He calculated back the generations of religious figures going back to Adam and this time and discovered that the world began on Oct 22, 4004 BC at 6PM. 



- Sedimentary rocks have oldest rock at the bottom. Find out how long it took to make each layer. However, layers ars are not made at a regular rate. Thus, this method has problems. For example, there is a lot of variety in answers, and even the deepest layers of rock are not the oldest things on earth.



- An asteroid hit the Grand Canyon about 50,000 years ago. Knowing the age of the iron at this crater would tell us the age of the Earth



- the atoms of each unstable element decay at a constant rate


- Uranium turns into lead



- Harrison Brown in 1947 and Clair Patterson:

	- Patterson was asked to find the amount of lead in zircon crystals

	- Tilton was measuring uranium in the same crystals, and he kept getting constant results. Patterson's kept varying 

	- They went to Caltech, and Patterson built an ultra-clean room and was finally able to accurately measure the lead
-he used a mass spectrometer to find the earth is 4.5 billion years old



- Lead was used extensively in the Roman Empire, despite knowing it was toxic


- Lead is poisonous because it mimics other metals that our cells need to grow and flourish. It blocks neurotransmitters and cannot help cells


-Tetraethyl gas began to be made in leaded gasoline


-Its makers were going crazy 


-Robert Kehoe was hired by GM and tried fixing the public image of lead. He said that there was no evidence to show it posed a threat to a consumer, and no one questioned him 



- Patterson's research made him the expert on calculating trace amounts of lead


- He found lead in the shallow seas had arrived more recently


- He published his research showing leaded gasoline was contaminating the water



-Eventually, lead was banned from US consumer products thanks to Patterson

Episode 8 - "Sisters of the Sun"


- We have an ancient relationship with the stars. Our ancestor recognized patterns in the stars, connected the dots, and formed pictures in the sky.



- One such star cluster was the Pleiades, each brighter than our Sun. Our ancestors told stories of the origin of these stars. Stories include:
  
	- Long ago, a group of women snuck away from their campsite to dance freely, when they were attacked by bears. A rock heard their cries and grew into the Devil's Tower. The maidens were transformed into the stars.
  
	- Greeks saw the 7 stars are maidens being pursued by a hunter mad with desire.



- In 1901, Edward Charles Pickering assembled a team of women to map and record stars. Two accomplished women include Annie Jump Cannon, who cataloged 250,000 stars, and Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who discovered how to measure the distances to the stars and the size of the universe. 



- Annie discovered that stars sequentially fall into 7 broad categories according to spectral line patterns, each of which had 10 numerical subclasses. 



- In 1923, Cecilia Payne analyzed Annie's data, showing that Annie's system of classification is a temperature scale of the stars (in her PhD thesis Stellar Atmospheres, now a standard textbook in the field). Payne opens up the way to modern astrophysics.



- When atoms fuse in the hearts of stars, they form starlight. Stars are born in litters, formed from the gas and dust of interstellar clouds. The Pleiades are todlers, almost 100 million years old, still bound together by their mutual gravity. The Big Dipper are adolescence, almost half a billion years old. Eventually they'll spread out into the Milky Way. Our Sun is middle-aged.

Episode 10 - "The Electric Boy"

- Michael Faraday solved what Isaac Newton was stuck on, and helped give inspiration to Albert Einstein later on. 

- Without him, our machines would not exist, our computers and phones that we come to love and depend on will not exist. He can be considered the father of all machines. 

- He was also interested in the invisible forces such as lights and magnetic forces, and he wondered how they were connected to each other. 

- His discovery would eventually lead to what we knew today as the magnetic fields, the forces that exists but cannot be seen with our naked eyes.
