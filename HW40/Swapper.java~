/**
Java class Swapper creates a 2D array of unique 3- or 4-character Strings and display it in the terminal. It will then prompt the user to specify two locations, swap the items at these locations, and redisplay the array.
Improvements made in version 2: 
-User is told what two strings are being swapped upon inputing coordinates
-User is asked to confirm that this is what they would like to swap
-the two strings that are swapped become red
